<h1> My Hobbies </h1>

  <p class="intro">
    My hobbies consist of playing music, writing music, working as a tech and being a backline tech at gigs.
  That means that all my free time goes to music. <br>
  But not always my own music, i help several bands as a backline technician. Simplified it means  that i repair,
  clean and hand people their guitars from backstage during their concerts.<br>

  i'd love to pursue a career in the music industry but being a developer is a worthy alternative.
